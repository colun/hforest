# HilbertForest

HilbertForest is an approximate k-nearest neighbor search library using Hilbert curves.

## Features

- Spatial indexing using Hilbert curves
- k-nearest neighbor search support
- Python library with C++ implementation

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- g++ (C++14 compatible)

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colun/hforest.git
cd hforest
make
```

## Expected Data Format

This library is optimized for data in one of the following formats:

1. **Unit vectors**: Data normalized to L2 norm of 1
2. **Normalized Gaussian distribution**: Data where each coordinate follows a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation `1/âˆšd` (where d is the number of dimensions)

Performance may degrade for data that significantly deviates from these conditions.

## Main Parameters

### Constructor Parameters

- `db_path` (str, default="db"): Directory for index file storage
- `ntrees` (int, default=10): Number of trees to build (trade-off between accuracy and speed)
- `leaf_size` (int, default=1): Minimum leaf node size
- `verbose` (int, default=1): Verbosity level (0: silent, 1: normal, 2: detailed)
- `seed` (int, default=-1): Random seed (-1 for automatic)

### Search Parameters

After creating the index, you can adjust search behavior with the following parameters:

```python
# Adjust number of trees used during search
index.ntrees = 5            # Use 5 out of the built trees

# Adjust candidate counts
index.odd_candidates = 11   # Number of candidates for leaf nodes with odd size
index.even_candidates = 10  # Number of candidates for leaf nodes with even size
index.dist_candidates = 100 # Number of candidate points for distance calculation

# Search range
index.hops = 1  # Search range around candidate points
```

## Limitations

- Tested with 384-dimensional data
- Index files are stored in the specified directory
